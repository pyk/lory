/// A prelude for crates using the `lory` crate.
///
/// This prelude is similar to the standard library's prelude in that you'll
/// almost always want to import its entire contents, but unlike the standard
/// library's prelude you'll have to do so manually.
///
/// An example of using this is:
///
/// ```
/// use lory::prelude::*;
/// ```
///
/// We may add items to this over time as they become ubiquitous as well, but
/// otherwise this should help cut down on futures-related imports when you're
/// working with the `lory` crate!

pub use crate::app::*;
